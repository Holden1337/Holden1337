### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Holden and I currently live in Columbus, Ohio. I mostly program in Python but also do some stuff in C++ as well. I have a hackerrank account
(https://www.hackerrank.com/ruegger_2) as well as a codewars account (https://www.codewars.com/users/HoldenRuegger). I am generally interested in 
the intersection of data analysis and engineering. I am currently learning/improving my knowledge for the standard data analysis libraries for Python 
such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
